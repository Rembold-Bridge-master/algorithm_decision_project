# Algorithms as Decision Makers
When we say the word “algorithm”, we tend to ascribe agency to the computer. It is deciding things for us. But the reality is that there is no magic. Software developers like you and me design and create sets of rules that the computer carries out for us.

These algorithms are all around us, and they are constantly making decisions.

The decisions that we make in code impact the lives of real people. For example, the Silicon Valley Triage Tool is an algorithm that identifies homeless people for whom giving them housing would cost the public less than keeping them homeless. So even as we learn the structures of code and how to become better programmers, we need to consider how we can make good decisions in the code that we write.

In this project you’ll explore this idea in a context that may be familiar to some of you: determining priority for choice on when to take paid time off. Many commercial enterprises can not function well if the number of workers drops below a threshold, and thus not everyone gets to take their paid-time off whenever they want it. In the case where many workers want to take a certain day off but only a limited number can, many companies fall back on some point-based or priority system to help determine who is granted their PTO request. You might not think of it immediately as one, but this point-based or priority system is based on some algorithm.

As part of this project, you’ll practice:

* Translating English rule-sets into code
* Soliciting input from others
* Applying conditionals to make decisions within a program
* The application of an accumulation variable to keep track of information in the program
* Integrating basic human-centered design processes into your programs
